# Trackhouse Racing Team Knowledge Base

## Team Overview

Trackhouse Racing is headquartered in Lexington, North Carolina, and was founded in 2021. The team is owned by Justin Marks and rapper Pitbull (Armando Christian Pérez). The team's website is https://trackhouse.com/.

As of the current season, Trackhouse Racing has earned 0 championships, 3 pole positions, and 8 race wins across their NASCAR Cup Series competition.

## Team History and Formation

Trackhouse Racing made its debut in 2021 when owner Justin Marks joined forces with rapper Pitbull to start the team, initially fielding the No. 99 Chevrolet for driver Daniel Suárez. 

In 2022, the team shocked the NASCAR world after purchasing former team Chip Ganassi Racing and hiring driver Ross Chastain to drive the No. 1 Chevrolet. This acquisition transformed Trackhouse from a single-car operation into a multi-car competitive team.

The team earned its first win with Chastain in 2022 at Circuit of The Americas and went on to win two more races in 2022 at Talladega Superspeedway (Chastain) and Sonoma Raceway (Suárez). In 2022, Ross Chastain was one of the Championship 4 drivers after his now famous "Hail Melon" move.

## Current Drivers

### Ross Chastain - No. 1 Chevrolet

Ross Chastain is in his fourth year driving the No. 1 Chevrolet for Trackhouse Racing. Chastain collected his first win, and the organization's first win, at Circuit of The Americas in 2022. He followed that up four weeks later with a victory at Talladega Superspeedway.

Chastain's most memorable moment came in the penultimate race of 2022 at Martinsville, where he pulled off a miracle move to reach the Championship 4, ultimately coming up short to Joey Logano at Phoenix. This move became known as the "Hail Melon" and involved Chastain riding the wall at high speed to gain positions on the final lap.

His most recent win came at Charlotte Motor Speedway in May 2025, delivering Trackhouse its first crown jewel victory by taking home the checkered flag in the Coca-Cola 600.

Before joining Trackhouse, Chastain drove the No. 42 for Chip Ganassi Racing in 2021 before that team was sold and rebranded as Trackhouse. He previously drove the No. 10 Kaulig Racing machine in the 2020 NASCAR Xfinity Series.

In 2019, Chastain shifted gears midseason to run for the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series championship with Niece Motorsports and won three races. Continuing in a part-time role with the team, he picked up his fifth series win in 2024 at Darlington Raceway. He has also earned two NASCAR Xfinity Series wins, at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in 2018 and Daytona International Speedway in 2019.

### Daniel Suárez - No. 99 Chevrolet

Daniel Suárez is in his ninth season in the NASCAR Cup Series and his fifth driving for Trackhouse Racing, a team co-owned by Justin Marks and global music star Pitbull.

Suárez became the first Mexican-born driver to win a Cup Series race by winning at Sonoma Raceway in 2022, in his 195th start. This historic victory was significant not only for Suárez personally but for NASCAR's growing international appeal. His latest Cup win came at Atlanta Motor Speedway in February 2024.

Suárez has a special connection to Mexico, having won the Xfinity Series race at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City, scoring a victory in front of his home-country fans.

During his time as an Xfinity regular, Suárez won the Sunoco Rookie of the Year award in 2015 and followed that by winning the series championship in 2016, making him the first foreign-born driver to win a NASCAR national series championship.

### Shane van Gisbergen - No. 88 Chevrolet

Shane van Gisbergen, commonly referred to as "SVG," joined Trackhouse Racing as a full-time Cup Series driver in 2025. The former Australian Supercars driver became the talk of the motorsports world in 2023 after winning the inaugural Cup Series race at the Chicago Street Course as part of Trackhouse's Project 91 program.

Van Gisbergen boasts an impressive international resume with wins in the Bathurst 12 Hour, a podium finish in the 24 Hours of Daytona, and three championships in the Australian Supercars series.

In 2024, SVG competed full-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 97 for Kaulig Racing. Van Gisbergen earned his first Xfinity win in June 2024 at Portland International Raceway and collected two more victories at Sonoma Raceway and the Chicago Street Course.

Currently racing full-time in the NASCAR Cup Series driving the No. 88 Chevrolet for Trackhouse Racing, van Gisbergen won the inaugural race at Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez in Mexico City in June 2025. Most recently, van Gisbergen won the Cup Series race at Watkins Glen in August 2025, making it his fourth consecutive road-course win, establishing himself as a road course specialist.

## Special Programs

### Project 91

Trackhouse Racing operates a special program called Project 91, which encourages drivers from other motorsports disciplines to try their hand in NASCAR. This innovative program has brought international attention to both the team and NASCAR.

The program's most notable success came in 2023 when Shane van Gisbergen won in his NASCAR debut with Project 91, taking home the victory in the inaugural Chicago Street Course race. This victory was particularly significant as it demonstrated the program's effectiveness in bringing elite talent from other racing series into NASCAR.

Van Gisbergen's success with Project 91 eventually led to him joining Trackhouse as a full-time driver in 2025, showing how the program can serve as both a talent pipeline and a way to evaluate potential future team members.

## Team Philosophy and Culture

Trackhouse Racing has established itself as an innovative and internationally-minded team in NASCAR. The partnership between Justin Marks and Pitbull brought a unique entertainment and business perspective to the sport, while programs like Project 91 demonstrate the team's commitment to bringing global talent into NASCAR.

The team's success has been built on a combination of strategic acquisitions (like purchasing Chip Ganassi Racing), international talent development, and creating opportunities for drivers from diverse backgrounds to succeed in NASCAR.
