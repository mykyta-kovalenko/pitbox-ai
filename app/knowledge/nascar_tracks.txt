## EchoPark Speedway (Atlanta Motor Speedway)

**Location**: Hampton, GA  
**Founded**: 1960  
**Spectator Capacity**: 71,000  
**Surface**: Asphalt  
**Length**: 1.54 miles  
**Turns**: 4  
**Major Events**: Ambetter Health 400, Quaker State 400

### Track History and Characteristics

Located in Hampton, just outside of the city of Atlanta, Atlanta Motor Speedway has been hosting NASCAR Cup Series races since 1960. Originally opened as a 1.5-mile oval, the first race in Atlanta was won by Bobby Johns on October 30th, 1960.

Beginning in 1987, Atlanta Motor Speedway was moved to the last weekend of the season, crowning a new NASCAR champion each year. The most notable of these races was the 1992 event, where a tight six-way battle for the championship was decided during the race. The race saw Alan Kulwicki narrowly win his first championship over Bill Elliott by just 10 points in one of the closest championship battles in the history of the sport. This race is also notable for the debut of Jeff Gordon and the final race for NASCAR legend Richard Petty.

In 1997, Atlanta Motor Speedway underwent massive renovations. The track had the start/finish line relocated from what is now the backstretch to an all-new frontstretch, and the track adopted the current configuration it has now. This change had the track go from 1.52 miles to 1.54 miles, and the track became one of the fastest on the NASCAR schedule.

### Recent Changes and Current Configuration

In 2022, the track was reconfigured again, changing the banking to 28 degrees, and narrowing the track from 55 feet to 40 feet wide. This changed the style of racing at Atlanta, making it race closer to Daytona and Talladega superspeedway-style pack racing.

Currently, Atlanta hosts two NASCAR race weekends, the Ambetter Health 400 in February and the Quaker State 400 in June. In February 2024, Daniel Su√°rez prevailed over Ryan Blaney and Kyle Busch by 0.003 seconds in one of the closest finishes of all time.

In 2025, Speedway Motorsports rebranded the track to EchoPark Speedway ahead of the summer race, which kicks off the inaugural NASCAR In-Season Challenge.

## Bristol Motor Speedway

**Location**: Bristol, TN  
**Founded**: 1961  
**Spectator Capacity**: 162,000  
**Surface**: Concrete  
**Length**: 0.533 miles  
**Turns**: 4  
**Major Events**: Food City Dirt Race, Bass Pro Shops Night Race

### Track Characteristics and Nicknames

Bristol Motor Speedway is a concrete half-mile track in the mountains of Bristol, Tennessee. Bristol was built in 1960 and has been nicknamed "The World's Fastest Half-Mile," "Thunder Valley" and "The Last Great Colosseum."

Bristol is one of the deepest banked tracks on the schedule, featuring 24 degrees of banking through the turns. This gives the track high speeds when entering the narrow turns. Since opening, Bristol has become a fan favorite due to the close-quarters racing the track creates and the frequency of the "bump-and-run" move that has become iconic at Bristol.

### Race Events and Notable Moments

Bristol has hosted two races per year since opening. The first event is the Food City 500 in the spring, and the Bristol Night race in August. The Bristol night race has become the track's "crown jewel" event due to the event being held on a Saturday night and the style of racing it produces.

The most famous race at the track was in 1995 during the night race, where Dale Earnhardt spun Terry Labonte as the two cars crossed the finish line on the last lap of the race. Other notable races at this track have occurred in 2010 and 2017, when Kyle Busch swept the weekend, winning the Truck Series, Xfinity Series, and Cup Series races in a row.

### Dirt Racing Period

From 2021-2023, the Truck Series and the Cup Series ran the spring events at Bristol on a dirt-covered surface, adding a unique element to the traditional concrete racing surface.

## Charlotte Motor Speedway

**Location**: Concord, NC  
**Founded**: 1960  
**Surface**: Pavement  
**Length**: 1.5 miles  
**Turns**: 4  
**Major Events**: Coca-Cola 600, Bank of America ROVAL 400

### Track Significance and Location

First opening in 1960, Charlotte Motor Speedway is the flagship property of Speedway Motorsports Inc. A "home game" for most NASCAR teams, Charlotte Motor Speedway sits in the heart of NASCAR country, with most of the NASCAR race teams headquartered in and around the Charlotte area.

Charlotte Motor Speedway is 1.5 miles long and features 24 degrees of banking into the corners.

### The Coca-Cola 600

The most notable and prestigious event hosted by the track is the Memorial Day Weekend Coca-Cola 600. At 600 miles, it is the longest race on the NASCAR schedule, testing both the limits of the driver and the car. The race is also unique in that it starts in the afternoon and finishes at night, forcing drivers and crews to adjust the car to accommodate the changing track conditions throughout the race.

### The ROVAL Configuration

Charlotte Motor Speedway also has a 17-turn, 2.28-mile road course, referred to as the "Roval." This layout was first used in NASCAR in 2018, with the addition of a chicane on the front and back straightaways.

The drivers head down the frontstretch but turn hard left before Turn 1 on the oval, and head into the infield road course. Turns 6 and 16 were reconfigured before the 2024 race.

This track is challenging for drivers due to the long, sweeping corners, elevation changes, and heavy braking areas. The Roval serves as the final race of the NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs Round of 12, making it a critical elimination race in the championship battle.

## Daytona International Speedway

**Location**: Daytona Beach, FL  
**Founded**: 1958  
**Spectator Capacity**: 150,000  
**Surface**: Asphalt  
**Length**: 2.5 miles  
**Turns**: 4  
**Major Events**: DAYTONA 500, Coke Zero Sugar 400

### Historical Foundation

The history of Daytona International Speedway began in 1953 when Bill France Sr. realized the days of racing on the beach were numbered due to spreading land usage of a rapidly growing population and huge race crowds. France put his plans for the future of racing in Daytona Beach, Florida in motion on April 4, 1953 with a proposal to construct a permanent speedway facility.

On August 16, 1954, France signed a contract with City of Daytona Beach and Volusia County officials to build what would become Daytona International Speedway, the "World Center of Racing."

### Track Design and Construction

In 1957, land clearing began for the Speedway. The famous 31-degree high banks were included in the design of the track so higher speeds could be achieved and to make it easier for fans to see the cars race around the 2.5-mile tri-oval. The dirt for the banking was taken from the infield and resulted in a 29-acre space that is known as Lake Lloyd.

### The First DAYTONA 500

Racing moved from the beach-road course to Daytona International Speedway in 1959 and the first DAYTONA 500 took place on February 22 in front of a crowd of over 41,000. Car entries included both hard tops and convertibles (it was the only DAYTONA 500 that included convertibles).

The finish of the inaugural DAYTONA 500 was too close to call. Johnny Beauchamp went to Victory Lane, but 61 hours later Lee Petty was declared the official winner after a clip of newsreel footage showed that Petty nipped Beauchamp at the line by approximately two feet.

### Multi-Disciplinary Racing Venue

In 1961, the DAYTONA 200 motorcycle race was moved from the beach to the Speedway. The following year, DIS hosted the inaugural running of what is now known as the Rolex 24 At DAYTONA, North America's most prestigious sports car race. The race was initially a three-hour race and became the 24-hour race we know it as today in 1966.

### DAYTONA Rising Renovation

On July 5, 2013, ground broke on the $400 million DAYTONA Rising frontstretch renovation project that would transform the historic speedway into a state-of-the-art motorsports facility. The Speedway now has approximately 101,500 permanent, wider and more comfortable seats, 40 escalators, 17 elevators, twice as many restrooms, three times as many concession stands and three concourse levels that span the nearly mile-long frontstretch.

In addition, the Speedway features over 60 luxury suites with trackside views and a completely revamped hospitality experience for corporate guests. The project was completed in January 2016 and was awarded the SportsBusiness Journal's prestigious Sports Business Award for Sports Facility of the Year.

### Facility Usage and Events

The approximately 500-acre motorsports complex boasts the most diverse schedule of racing on the globe. In addition to at least nine major event weekends, the Speedway grounds are also used extensively for events that include concerts, civic and social gatherings, car shows, photo shoots, production vehicle testing and police motorcycle training.

In addition, Daytona International Speedway showcases daily track tours and is home to the champion DAYTONA 500 car and the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America.

### Track Characteristics and Banking

Las Vegas Motor Speedway features progressive banking through the corners, starting at 12 degrees and going all the way up to 20 degrees. This progressive banking creates unique racing dynamics as drivers can choose different lines through the corners depending on their car's setup and racing conditions.

### Multi-Purpose Facility

In addition to the oval layout, the property also has a drag strip, dirt track and a .375-mile oval utilized by ARCA Menards Series West. The facility's diverse racing offerings make it one of the most versatile motorsports complexes in the country.

### Playoff Racing and Schedule Expansion

In 2018, Las Vegas was awarded a second race, this time in September. This was the first race in the NASCAR playoffs for Las Vegas with all three of the NASCAR series racing there. Currently, all three series visit Las Vegas in March while the Cup and Xfinity Series return in October for the playoff race.

### Entertainment and Fan Experience

In addition to NASCAR, Las Vegas Motor Speedway hosts one of the largest EDM music festivals in the country, with over 300,000 in attendance.
